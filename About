# waveos
A web operating system for websites such as Tumblr with advanced file integration, support for gifs in link dock in Wave OS.
Very user customizable once you get the hang of finding the bits you need to change to make it your own.
Future version would be to add the customization to the tumblr settings panel, but for now this is version 1.0
